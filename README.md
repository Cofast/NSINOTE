# NSINOTE
Project carried out on final year of secondary school
We had to create an internet platform to see our notes, schedule, a platform of the style "Pronote" (France).
We were in a group of 5 to create this. 
We created the database with SQL scripts, made our web pages with HTML, CSS, PHP. In addition, we used XAMPP to put our database there and connect it with our site. It consisted of several pages, one of home where to choose our type of profile (Student, Parents, teacher) with forms of verification of passwords and username.
We made the permissions for each type, possibility of adding grades + corrections of homework for example for teachers.
